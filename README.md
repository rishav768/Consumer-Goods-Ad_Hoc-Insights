# Consumer Goods Ad_Hoc Insights

I have successfully completed the 4th project from Codebasics, titled "Provide Insights to Management in the Consumer Goods Domain." In this project, I worked with data hosted on a MySQL server, which I accessed and extracted using SQL queries. After extracting the data, I utilized Excel and Power Query to clean, organize, and transform it, ensuring it was ready for analysis. Finally, I used Power BI to create detailed and visually compelling reports, providing valuable insights to the management team. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data extraction, transformation, and visualization, enhancing my ability to deliver actionable insights from complex datasets.
